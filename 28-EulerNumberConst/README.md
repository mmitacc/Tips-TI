1.- First, 02 files have been created to generate â€œFactorial of the number n": 
- factorialR.js : Recursive algorithm.
- factorialNormal.js : Normal algorithm.
2.- This folder uses the file "numberE.js" (recursive algorithm) to generate the "EULER constant" and import the file "factorialR.js", with a precision of "n" iterations.
3.- In this example, all loops from 1 to n=20 have been printed. And on the last line, the Euler value generated by JavaScript is printed. For comparison purposes..
